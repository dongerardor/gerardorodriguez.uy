        <p>Most of the time, programming in Python or JavaScript. Beyond that, sudying, reading (news from abroad and
            some books), playing guitar and being amazed with tech. As usual. But now more than ever.</p>

        <h3>Os Indicadores Release! Version 3.0.0</h3>
        <p>Os Indicadores Release! Version 3.0.0 of our profitability forecasting product is now in the hands of our
            customers with numerous new features and performance improvements.</p>
        <div id="images">
            <img src="./images/osindicadores_panel1.png" />
            <img src="./images/osindicadores_panel2.png" />
        </div>
        <div id="about" class="hidden">
            <p>Os Indicadores is a Brazilian financial advisory company with numerous local clients that decided to take
                a step towards innovation and entrepreneurship by taking some of its services to the cloud.
                One of them -the most fun, if you ask me- is profitability forecasting. That is, using company data,
                historical and hypothetical scenarios are built that allow decision makers to establish strategies in an
                informed manner.</p>
            <p>Throughout this adventure I had several roles: developer, team leader, data storyteller, among others.
                Mainly contributing with technical work, but sometimes just drinking beer and dreaming about the amazing
                world that's coming next.</p>
            <p>Depending on the stage of the project - which has been going on for a long time now and saw many talented
                professionals involved - we had to adapt ourselves to different challenges.</p>
            <p>So I can proudly say that, after all those many sleepless nights with a committed and
                enthusiastic team, today we are helping our customers to talk with their data and listen to what it has
                to
                tell.</p>
