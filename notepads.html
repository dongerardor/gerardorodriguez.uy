            <h4>NOTEPAD</h4>
            <h3>Teams at the very heart of any company</h3>

            <p>For quite some time I have had the chance to collaborate with <a
                    href="https://www.apprecia.co">Apprecia</a>,
                a company focused on leadership and high-performance teams development. In addition to being
                practitioners,
                Apprecia produce knowledge related to an area whose importance can hardly be exaggerated when talking
                about
                modern organizations.</p>

            <p>This collaboration has contributed decisively to my perspective on the value generation capacity of
                teams,
                when they are well constructed and carry out the necessary reflection on their operating rules and
                objectives.</p>

            <p>Today, organizations that create value through knowledge have innovation challenges that have render
                hierarchical structures archaic, just to give way to dynamic, matrix organized companies, whose basic
                value
                generation cell is the team.</p>

            <p>Such is the relevance of knowing and embracing the science of high-performance equipment.</p>

            <p>But what is a team? And how does a high-performance team should be configured? What are the dynamics that
                allow us to achieve that? These are broad questions, but we can say that:</p>

            <blockquote>"Who is on the team is less important than how members interact, structure their work, and
                perceive
                their contributions."</blockquote>

            <p>This is taken from <a
                    href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-emea/consumer-insights/consumer-trends/five-dynamics-effective-team/">"Think
                    with Google: Team dynamics: Five keys to building effective teams"</a></p>


            <p>This is a required reading for anyone on a team. Part of the path is, more than simply bringing together
                the
                best and putting them to work, look to five dynamics that will differentiate the best performing teams
                from
                the
                rest:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Psychological safety. Members can take risks or make proposals knowing that this will never work
                    against
                    them.</li>
                <li>Trust: Members trust that quality work will be completed and will do what they can to do so.</li>
                <li>Structure and clarity: roles, objectives and plans are clear and people know what is expected of
                    them.
                </li>
                <li>Meaning: the vital sense of purpose.</li>
                <li>Impact: members believe that their work makes a difference.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Teams science is certainly not new, and there is vast literature and academic production on the subject.
                (Check here <a
                    href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/high-performing-teams-a-timeless-leadership-topic">"High-performing
                    teams: A timeless leadership topic", by McKinsey</a>)</p>

            <blockquote>“Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships.” <br /><br /> Michael
                Jordan
            </blockquote>


            <p>Let's check out this HBR article (<a href="https://hbr.org/2022/09/what-is-a-good-job">What is a good
                    job?</a>), where the author-researcher maintains that -beyond
                the
                definition of what a "good job" can be-, this always, unfailingly, appears with the individual belonging
                to
                a
                reliable and performing team.</p>

            <p>Among the vast literature that exists on teams, I especially want to recommend the book <a
                    href="https://the-leadership-store.myshopify.com/es-uy/products/construir-equipos-ganadores-field-book-papel-uruguay"></a>Building
                Winning
                Teams ("Construir Equipos Ganadores", so far spanish only),
                by Julio Martínez Itté. It brings together both research and theory as well as the practice of having
                helped
                numerous teams throughout an extensive career.</p>
